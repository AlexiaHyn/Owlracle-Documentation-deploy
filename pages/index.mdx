2. üìù Synthesizes the answer based on user question
3. ‚ö°**Learns independently if unable to answer correctly at first**‚ö°

* [Modal](https://github.com/Open-Nice/Owlracle-DB-manager/blob/main/event_scrape.py): manages(create, update, delete) VectorDB information.
* [Perplexity AI](https://github.com/Open-Nice/Owlracle-DB-manager): does due diligence every night to teach vectorDB new information.

## Motivation

Rice is greatly resourceful. But the problem I faced ever since I was a Freshmen is that the resource is scattered all around. So I believe there is value in creating 1) an internal database which every Owl has read and edit access 2) a friendly chat interface to learn more about the resources.

So we decided to leverage the capabilities of Large Language Model to address this.

## Stack
