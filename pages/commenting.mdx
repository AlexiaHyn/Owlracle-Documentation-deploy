# ðŸ’¬ Responding to Sweep

You can respond to Sweep in three places:
1. **Issue**: Sweep will create a new pull request and close the old one. Alternatively, you can edit the issue description to recreate the pull request.
2. **Pull request**: Sweep will update the PR based on your PR comments
3. **Code**: Sweep will only update the file that the comment is on

Whenever you make a message that Sweep is taking a look at, you will see an ðŸ‘€ emoji. If you don't see this, make sure the PR/issue is open and you prefixed the message with "sweep:".

Further, on failed Github Action runs, Sweep will update the PR based on the error message.
